        <h2>Watamu Weather </h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Watamu has two rainy seasons – a short rainy season in November and December and a long rainy season from April through June which starts sprinkles by end of March, with May being considered the wettest month. During the long rainy season, heavy downpours are expected in the afternoon in comparison to less frequent and lighter showers during the short rainy season. 
          We consider July through October to <b>be the best time to visit Watamu</b>, as this is the longest dry season with cool coastal conditions and the skies are clear and sunny, but Watamu is a beautiful coastal destination no matter when you visit. The second dry and humid season is much shorter and lasts from January to February and early parts of March. The Indian Ocean coastline tends to be more humid that inland areas and average annual temperatures are generally in the lower to mid-80s degrees Fahrenheit (26-30 Celsius) during the day and lower to mid-70s degrees Fahrenheit (21-24 Celsius) at night. January to March are the warmest months, with daytime temperatures in the lower 90’s Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) and the coolest months are July and August with average temperatures in the lower-80s Fahrenheit (27 Celsius) during the day.
